# 🧠 Brain Tumor Scan AI

Brain Tumor Scan AI is a web-based application for **brain tumor classification from MRI images** using **Fine-tuned DenseNet121**. The system allows users to upload MRI scans, processes them with a trained neural network model, and displays prediction results with confidence scores and visualizations.

This project is built using **Flask** for the backend and **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend.
